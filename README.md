# Financial-Market-Datasets-2024-Project
In this project, I analyzed financial and economic data across 39 countries to understand how stock indices, macroeconomic indicators, and risk factors interact in shaping global markets. Using SQL as my primary tool, I investigated over thousands of cross-country records, uncovering relationships between inflation, policy interest rates, bond yields, and equity market performance.


# Why This Project? (English)
The global financial landscape in 2024 was shaped by rising interest rates, inflationary pressures, and shifting investor sentiment across regions. I chose this project because it allowed me to connect real-world financial events with data analytics skillsâ€”bridging the gap between business context and technical analysis.
By working with a multi-country dataset, I could explore not just numbers, but stories hidden in the data: how emerging markets reacted differently from developed ones, why currencies moved the way they did, and what outliers like Japan and Argentina can teach us about economic resilience and instability.
For me, this project was an opportunity to practice SQL for large-scale data handling, while also sharpening my ability to generate insights that matter to investors, analysts, and policymakers.
