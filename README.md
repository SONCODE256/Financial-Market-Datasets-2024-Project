Analyzing Global Financial Markets: A Data-Driven Exploration of 2024 Trends

In this project, I analyzed financial and economic data across 39 countries to understand how stock indices, macroeconomic indicators, and risk factors interact in shaping global markets. Using SQL as my primary tool, I investigated over thousands of cross-country records, uncovering relationships between inflation, policy interest rates, bond yields, and equity market performance.
